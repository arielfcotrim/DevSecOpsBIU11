# Git Basics (commit, diff, branches)

1. Done
2. Red
3. Red
4. Green
5. In step 2, the status was "new file: abc.txt" in red. Now it appears as "modified: abc.txt", also in red.
6. git diff
7. git diff
8. If all changes have already been committed / no change has been added to index, then there will be no difference to show.
9. Because of incorrect syntax (missing "--" and "2" isn't a file; also missing space between "stage" and "2".
10. Done
11. It prints nothing because there is no difference between the working tree and the index.
12. git diff-index main
13. Done
14. They would not. --staged shows what has been added to index that's different from main, "main" will show everything that's different from main.
15. Because the changes, "1" and "2", have been staged; whereas the change, "3", hasn't.
16. Done

5. In general, we should always aim to maintain the logical flow of development. If we have a feature branch that is dependent on another feature branch, we should merge the dependent feature branch into the main branch first, and then merge the main branch into the feature branch. This way, we can avoid merge conflicts and keep the history of the project clean (for example).
